 Usage

 Playing Blackjack is easy and fun! Here are the basic rules:

 1. **Objective**: Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over.

 2. **How to Play**:
    - Click the "Deal" button to start the game.
       - You'll receive two cards, and the dealer will have one face-up card.
          - Decide whether to "Hit" (get another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand).
	     - Keep hitting until you're satisfied with your hand or go over 21, in which case you lose.
	        - The dealer will then reveal their face-down card and hit until they reach 17 or higher.

		3. **Winning**: If your hand beats the dealer's hand without going over 21, you win the round.

		4. **Special Rules**: Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) pays 3:2.
